# Introducing: KeyboardFu

Ahh, the smell of a new website. It's like a fresh pancake on a cold morning. With some bacon, and always with coffee. Ever notice how websites smell like stale coffee? That's because the developer spilled at least one or two cups on the code to make it go faster. It's like a spoiler on, well, just about anything. It just plain goes faster.

## Cordial Welcome

There's no way you're still reading, but if you are, welcome to KeyboardFu.com. My name is Jake and I have contributed to the web development field professionally since 2003. I hope you will accept this virtual handshake as a warm welcome to a place full of insight, ponderous topics, and all-out tom-foolery.

## Content

My experience does not end at web development, nor is it limited to [PHP](http://php.net). Articles may contain many different languages as a means to solve a problem. In order to keep everything tidy and organized, all articles will be tagged to the languages included in them, as well as any other ancillary tags I feel like strapping to an article.

Additionally, articles may not even center around code itself, but tips on the professional development environment based on past experience. I've had the pleasure of building up web teams from a fledgling mess of FTP and "You overwrote my changes!" to a streamlined force to reckon with. It's not rocket science, but there are plenty of opportunities to fail.

## Release Schedule

I plan to release a new article for your enjoyment on Wednesday of every odd week of the year. If time exists to produce articles more often, I will certainly make sure I can keep the pace before attempting to do so. Much research will go into every article to ensure it contains the most accurate information, which takes a lot of time.

Some articles may contain pretty pictures. Most articles will contain code samples. Maybe some day I'll even reveal the guts of how this very site works. Wouldn't that be neat?
