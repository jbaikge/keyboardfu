Look down at your keyboard, what do you see?

Do you see the product of an alphabet monster sneezing letters, whereby you must tap each letter bubble to tame the lesser beast your keyboard is connected to?

Do you see a vast array of little letters, scattered about incomprehensibly, waiting to be tapped and bopped to communicate with anyone you please?

Do you see an implement of corporate monotony, spinning your hamster wheel of emails and reports around one more turn with every smash of a key?

I see a tool. One which is comfortable at my fingertips and the basis of my craft. It is the hammer; and code, the burning ore.

Writing code is an art. KeyboardFu devotes itself to exploring ways to write more concise, legible code, while pushing performance to the highest degree possible.
