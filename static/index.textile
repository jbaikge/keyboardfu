bq. *Keyboard Fu* _n._ The art of keyboarding, specifically in the programming arena.

KeyboardFu.com hosts the presence of Jake Tews, web developer and inquisitive explorer of ones and zeros.

This isn't a blog about my pet cat, how to build a Hello World program in 30 different languages, and my portfolio of how I know 3 HTML(HyperText Markup Language) tags. Instead, it's a collection of articles pertaining to my -pet giraffe- findings while developing in any language I happen to need for a specific problem and my portfolio of notable accomplishments on various websites I've worked on.

Enjoy the content. Enjoy the art.
