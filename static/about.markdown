# About KeyboardFu

Look down at your keyboard, what do you see?

Do you see a vast collection of keys in an incomprehensible order, and a means of communicating with anyone you please?

Do you see an implement of corporate monotony, whereby smashing on those little keys spins your hamster wheel of emails and reports around one more turn?

I see a tool. One which is comfortable at my fingertips and a necessary component of my craft. It is the hammer; code, the nail.

Writing code is an art. KeyboardFu devotes itself to exploring ways to write more concise, legible code, while pushing performance to the highest degree possible.
